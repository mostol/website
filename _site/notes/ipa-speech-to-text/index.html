  <h1>IPA Speech-to-Text Model…?</h1><p>Here's a thought: we've got <a href="https://huggingface.co">speech-to-text</a> models galore. We can take audio input from dozens (now hundreds?) of languages and feed it into a model, and out comes some text that matches. <a href="https://twitter.com/twominutepapers">What a time to be alive!</a> But hey, those strings of text that the models spit out—what if those were <em>IPA</em> letters, instead of specifically Kazakh or French or Navajo or another particular alphabet's representation? That might be neat! Let's see what we can do...</p>
<h2>Getting data</h2>
<p>We should really probably use a pre-trained model, but in theory it seems like if a model is already trained on human language in general, it should be okay with a taking variety of languages' acoustic inputs. The trickier part is getting an annotated dataset that has audio labelled in IPA characters. One potential source: the [Wiktionary](https://wiktionary.org/], which conveniently has recordings <em>and</em> IPA representations (though not necessarily <em>precise transcriptions</em>) from words in hundreds of languages.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org/IPAcharts/IPA_chart_orig/pdfs/IPA_Kiel_2020_symbollist.pdf">Here's a chart of all of the IPA characters</a>, which will probably be helpful.</p>
