  <h1>Notes on notes</h1><p>I want to stumble upon some truth here, or something. I'm really struggling with note-taking systems. Here are some of the issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Up-front cost. I have a hard time commiting myself to some system of organization. I'm too easily distracted, I end up in rabbit holes or going off in the weeds. It doesn't help that I feel a constant inclination to have to re-implement or create everything myself—I really need to be okay using something that already exists. Maybe <em>some</em> things need reassessment, but I certainly should'nt be wasting time reinventing <em>every</em> wheel.</li>
<li>Abandonment. This might also be a barrier-to-entry issue like the one above. It may be because I find it hard to get going, or the methods I've seen feel like they require too much pre-formatting or pre-organization or whatever, but I have a hard time keeping consistent with any kind of note-taking and I end up quitting pretty frequently, which just leaves everything scattered and even <em>more</em> unorganized.</li>
<li>Waiting for Prince Charming. Because nothing seems to have been an instant fit that has felt completely natural or whatever, I often just give up and decide to do nothing until I find &quot;the one.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>(Side note: even these ideas right now feel jumbled. This isn't organized, these points are redundant, the thoughts don't feel complete)</p>
<p>Anyways, what are solutions here? How can I get this all to work, so I can go somewhere and get thoughts down and not always walk away empty-handed?</p>
<ol>
<li>Flexibility. I want to be able to change my mind—if I don't have to commit completely to a setup or an idea or framework, I can just get started without being afraid of messing up my choices. I like the garden idea (onescatteredming or whatever his name is)—I want to be able to go back and tend to thoughts as needed or at my leisure, rather than having to adhere to persistent perfection and systemitization.</li>
<li>Automation. To make me have to do less work (and less systemitizing), things should be automated. Make the machine work <em>for me</em>, instead of having to spend all my effort running it.</li>
<li>Low-effort contribution. Things shouldn't have to come in polished. I should just be able to dump them.</li>
<li>Maybe break free from what exists?</li>
</ol>
<p>So here are some things we could do, some approaches we could take:</p>
<ul>
<li>Big bucket approach. No folders, no separate locations. Let it all be a big soup—that could help a lot for eliminating mental pre-processing of notes.</li>
<li>Understand what I'm actually going to be searching for. Do I really want to know my stream-of-conscious thought process behind something? Maybe I do. If I'm doing information retrieval of <em>my own</em> information, what will I be trying to find?
<ul>
<li>References or resources, maybe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If we're doing deep learning stuff, I would ideally like to be as independent as possible, and not have to lug in all of GPT-3 or something. Byte transformers? Maybe some simpler machine learning method? Or some other heuristic?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's think about tags. What kinds of tags are actually useful? There are content tags (e.g. Machine Learning, philosophy, language). There are also functional-ish tags (e.g. to-do, notes for writing/publication, reference material).</p>
<p>I want things to be on a per-chunk level rather than a per-file level. Maybe? At least the linking thing, perhaps.</p>
<p>But, after trying a thing or two, I'm actually kind of...liking logseq?</p>
