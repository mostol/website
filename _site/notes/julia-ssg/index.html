  <p>Right now this site is built using <a href="https://11ty.dev">Eleventy</a>, but I'm also <em>really</em> interested in getting into the <a href="https://julialang.org">Julia</a> language. So I wonder…could I piece together something like that in Julia as a kind of getting-to-know-you project?</p>
<p>Julia seems to have some benefits that might be helpful here:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Type dispatching</strong> could be a really interesting way to handle the semantic content of HTML. Type-dispatched style sheets? Type-dispatched templates? Could be neat!</li>
<li>One of the great things about Eleventy is its <strong>flexibility</strong>—it doesn't want to be a framework you have to learn, it wants to be a tool that can play nicely with whatever you already know/use. That same approach could maybe be facilitated by leveraging Julia's <a href="https://techytok.com/lesson-other-languages/">interoperability</a> to let you use existing frameworks/templating systems/setups from a variety of languages (e.g. JavaScript).</li>
</ol>
