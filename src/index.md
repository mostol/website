I'm a [Human Language Technology](https://linguistics.arizona.edu/master-science-human-language-technology-hlt) student at the University of Arizona. Some other tidbits:
- BA in Comparative Literature
- Interested in language, deep learning, graphs, information retrieval, and wrapping my head around new things.
- I live in Phoenix, AZ with my wife and two [heelers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Cattle_Dog) (one of each flavor).
- I'm looking for an work! If LinkedIn is your thing, you can find my profile [here](https://linkedin.com/in/jacksonmostoller).

You can read more about what I've been up to on my [blog](/blog) or in my [notes](/notes).
