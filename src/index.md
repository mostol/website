# Hello
I'm <strong>Jackson Mostoller</strong> <em>(he/him)</em>, a person doing software stuff in Phoenix, Arizona (i.e. Akimel O'odham and Piipaash land).

In general, I'm interested in systems that make wrangling information more accessible and humanistic. Also into the desert, democracy, music, FOSS, abstracting things, recreational criticism<button popovertarget="crit"><sup>1</sup></button><span role="note" id="crit" popover>I'll have you know my Comp. Lit. degree does <em>license</em> me for extrarecreational criticism, so watch out.</span>, websites, indie games, Mazovian socio-economics, tomatillos, etc.

I'm currently a Machine Learning Engineer at [Cohere Health](https://coherehealth.com).

## This site
You can think of this space like something in between a [microblog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging) and a normal blog<button popovertarget="milliblog"><sup>2</sup></button><span role="note" id="milliblog" popover>â€¦milliblog?</span>. Posts may be short, incomplete, or incoherent, but they're here!

They might be further organized into more focused collections listed on the [topics page](/topics/).

You can find the full collection of posts [here](/posts/).
