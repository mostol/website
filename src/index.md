## About me
<div class="cblock">

I'm a Human Language Technology student at the University of Arizona. Some other details are:
- BA in Comparative Literature (plus a Mathematics minor)
- Interested in language, deep learning, graphs, information retrieval, web design/development, and wrapping my head around new things. 
- I live in Phoenix, AZ with my wife and two heelers (one of each flavor).
- I'm looking for an internship ðŸ˜‰

You can read more about what I've been up to on my [blog](/blog) or in my [notes](/notes).
