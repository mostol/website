# Hello
I'm <strong>Jackson Mostoller</strong> <em>(he/him)</em>, a person doing software stuff in Phoenix, Arizona (i.e. Akimel O'odham and Piipaash land).

In general, I'm interested in systems that make wrangling information more accessible and humanistic.

I'm currently a Machine Learning Engineer at [Cohere Health](https://coherehealth.com).

Some more fun facts:
- My BA is in Comparative Literature, and I also have an MS in [Human Language Technology](https://linguistics.arizona.edu/master-science-human-language-technology-hlt). I'm very grateful for both!
- I'm into the desert, democracy, music, FOSS, abstracting things, casual pizza criticism, websites, indie games, Mazovian socio-econimcs, anything tomatillo, etc.

## This site
You can think of this space like something in between a [microblog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging) and a normal blog. (â€¦A milliblog?) Posts may be short, incomplete, or incoherent, but they're here!

They might be further organized into more focused collections listed on the [topics page](/topics/).

You can find the full collection of posts [here](/posts/).
