Here's a thought: we've got [speech-to-text](https://huggingface.co) models galore. We can take audio input from dozens (now hundreds?) of languages and feed it into a model, and out comes some text that matches. [What a time to be alive!](https://twitter.com/twominutepapers) But hey, those strings of text that the models spit outâ€”what if those were *IPA* letters, instead of specifically Kazakh or French or Navajo or another particular alphabet's representation? That might be neat! Let's see what we can do...

## Getting data
We should really probably use a pre-trained model, but in theory it seems like if a model is already trained on human language in general, it should be okay with a taking variety of languages' acoustic inputs. The trickier part is getting an annotated dataset that has audio labelled in IPA characters. One potential source: the [Wiktionary](https://wiktionary.org/], which conveniently has recordings *and* IPA representations (though not necessarily *precise transcriptions*) from words in hundreds of languages. 

[Here's a chart of all of the IPA characters](https://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org/IPAcharts/IPA_chart_orig/pdfs/IPA_Kiel_2020_symbollist.pdf), which will probably be helpful.

[Here's some Julia package handling info.](https://blog.devgenius.io/the-most-underrated-feature-of-the-julia-programming-language-the-package-manager-652065f45a3a)

```julia
using JSON3

function get_words(file::String)
    a::Array{AbstractDict} = []
    for line in eachline(file)
        if occursin(r"\"ipa\"",line) && occursin(r"\"(mp3|ogg)_url\"")
            push!(a,JSON3.read(line).sounds)
        end
    end
    return a
end
```

Other things to improve:
* We probably want to narrow it down to items with *one* pronunciation, or we can't quite tell if we have the right pronunciation transcribed. (If we can find a way to differentiate e.g. between US and UK pronunciations and match each with the correct transcription, that'd be ðŸ’¯)
* There are (generally) two transcriptions: a [phonemic and a phonetic](https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/questions/301/when-should-one-use-slashes-or-square-brackets-when-transcribing-in-ipa), the phonemic (in square brackets) being the more narrow one in general. It's maybe preferable to grab that one but then againâ€”why not both? It might be handy to have either option available, or to compare and see which is a more successful basis for a model.
