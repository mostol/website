Are you a neuropsychologist? I am not a neuropsychologist. As noted in my [graph adventures](adventures-in-graphs.md), the first way that nerual networks made sense to me was not as a bunch of "neurons", because I don't know how neurons work, but as a kind of function as described by the [Universal Approximation Theorem](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem)
